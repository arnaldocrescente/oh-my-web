I constantly strive to enhance my skills and stay updated on cutting-edge technologies 📚, delivering increasingly efficient and innovative solutions 🚀. Outside of work, I enjoy various hobbies that keep me active and motivated. I love music 🎵, play the guitar 🎸, and attend many concerts 🎤. Trekking 🥾 helps me stay fit. Rugby 🏉 has taught me respect for my teammates and the importance of teamwork, principles I apply in my role as a developer and tech leader 👨‍💻. I also enjoy experimenting in the kitchen 🍳 and working with wood and metal 🛠️, creating various projects."
